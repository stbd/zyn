## Server
 * Think about when to close connection to client
 * Go trough client.rs to make sure trace levels are consistent
 * Make sure naming of blocks is consistent around system (not pages)
 * Cleanup responsibilities between file impl and metadata, who owns the data and who does the action
  * Cleanup file properties
 * Possibility to store protocol messages to file, to make debugging easier?
  * When debugging protocol, passwords are vissible in logs
 * Replace anything that mentions folder to directory
 * Open response should include block size
 * Cleanup and remove references to GPGME
 * Replace all encrypt/decrypt operations with encrypt_to_file and decrypt_from_file
 * Think how commands could be batched together

## CLI Client:
 * Handle large files better
  * When editing

## Web Client:
 * Sorting of directory content is different in different browsers
 * Math extension for showdown, lots of problems with showdown-katex, probably have to think about something else
 * Support for raw links, raw.server.path-file
 * Do not show large binary files in raw format for unsupported files

## Check
 * Are files closed when user disconnects, system test case

## Issues
 * It is possible to create file/folder with name that already exists under parent
 * Think about how to handle reopening file
  * Could user promote file from read mode to write mode?
 * Creating file with same name in different folder fails
  * self._create_file(cli, '/dir-1/file-1', '-ra')
  * self._create_file(cli, '/dir-2/file-1', '-ra')
 * Deleting/moving files on remote should be notified on client

## Security
 * Passwords are printed when protocol is debugged
 * Web server (and CLI) logs all edits on RA files
