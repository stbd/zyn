# todo
 * Think about when to close connection to client
 * Go trough client to make sure trace levels are consistent
 * Make sure naming of blocks is consistent around system (not pages)
 * Cleanup responsibilities between file impl and metadata, who owns the data and who does the action
  * Cleanup file properties
 * Possibility to store protocol messages to file, to make debugging easier?
 * Replace anything that mentions folder to directory
 * Open response should include block size
 * Rethink were properties should be stored, some cases it would make sense to have them in filesystem instead of description/metadata for faster access
 * Cleanup and remove references to GPGME

## Check
 * Are files closed when user disconnects, system test case

## Issues
 * It is possible to create file/folder with name that already exists under parent
 * Think about how to handle reopening file
  * Could user promote file from read mode to write mode?
