## Server
 * Think about when to close connection to client
 * Make sure naming of blocks is consistent around system (not pages)
 * Cleanup responsibilities between file impl and metadata, who owns the data and who does the action
  * Cleanup file properties
 * Possibility to store protocol messages to file, to make debugging easier?
  * When debugging protocol, passwords are vissible in logs
 * Cleanup and remove references to GPGME
 * Think how commands could be batched together

## CLI Client:

## Web Client:
 * Math extension for showdown, lots of problems with showdown-katex, probably have to think about something else
 * Do not show large binary files in raw format for unsupported files

## Check
 * Are files closed when user disconnects, system test case

## Issues
 * Think about how to handle reopening file
  * Could user promote file from read mode to write mode?
 * Deleting/moving files on remote should be notified on client

## Security
 * Passwords are printed when protocol is debugged
 * Web server (and CLI) logs all edits on RA files
