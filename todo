# todo
 * Think about when to close connection to client
 * Go trough client to make sure trace levels are consistent
 * Make sure naming of pages is consistent around system (not block)
 * Cleanup responsibilities between file impl and metadata, who owns the data and who does the action
  * Cleanup file properties
 * Refactor
 * Docker configuration for production
 * Possibility to store protocol messages to file, to make debugging easier

## Check
 * Are files closed when user disconnects, system test case

## Issues
 * It is possible to create file/folder with name that already exists under parent
