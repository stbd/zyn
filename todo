 * Fix user authority hash usage
 * Implement automatic release for locks when lock goes out of scope

 * Make sure naming of pages is consistent around system (not block)
 * When writing block file, previous version needs to be deleted
 * Cleanup responsibilities between file impl and metadata, who owns the data and who does the action
 * Refactor
  * Filesystem
   * Only N files should be stored for each folder
